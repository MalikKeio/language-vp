Atom plugin to highlight syntax according to the syntax rules of the Valkyrie
Anatomia script (https://github.com/valkyrieanatomia/valkyrie-anatomia-script).
This plugin even implements some handy keyboard shortcuts (such as adding
a character name automatically, etc.: that's super effective to efficiently
transcribe the game).
